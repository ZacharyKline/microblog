# microblog

Version 0.101
This program writes a simple hello world message when run, but it is done in Flask which is neat and new and not at all confusing. If you say it is confusing then you are in fact the worst person who has read this README.md file. You monster.

Version 0.2.2
Added some messages other than the one in the tutorial, also added HTML templates which automatically populate using the object we added.

Version 0.3
Added information to create a login form which adds onto the, and gives a link at the top of the page to toggle between home and the login form. I also added some secret word protection against leet hackers which are always trying to destroy my websites, with their weird hacker ways.

Version 0.4
Added database information and did a bunch of testing inside the shell. Imported modules flask-sqlalchemy and flask-migrate, and added app shell processor for the microblog.py
